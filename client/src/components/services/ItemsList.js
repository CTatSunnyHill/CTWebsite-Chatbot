            <h4>Assistive Gaming</h4>
            <p class="Bullet">The Xbox Adaptive Controller is a groundbreaking device designed by Microsoft to meet the needs of gamers with limited mobility. This inclusive piece of technology works by acting as a hub for assistive devices, allowing players to connect a wide range of external devices such as switches, buttons, and joysticks to create a custom controller setup tailored to their specific physical needs. Its large, programmable buttons and the connective ports array are engineered to be easily accessible, providing a flexible and adaptive gaming experience. The Xbox Adaptive Controller has been widely celebrated for its ability to open up video gaming to a broader audience, making play more accessible for individuals who might find traditional controllers challenging to use.</p>
            <p class="Bullet" >Jelly Bean Switches are another type of assistive technology that can be utilized for gaming. These switches are large, easy-to-press buttons that can be activated with a light touch or a push, making them ideal for users with fine motor challenges. When integrated with gaming setups like the Xbox Adaptive Controller, Jelly Bean Switches allow players to perform specific actions or commands in a game without the need for precise, complicated maneuvers. They are often color-coded for easy identification and can be mounted in various positions to cater to individual needs, providing a simple yet effective solution to engage with interactive entertainment.</p>
            <p class="Bullet">Flic switches represent a more modern approach to assistive technology in gaming. These wireless smart buttons are highly customizable and can be programmed to carry out a wide variety of functions, from simple clicks to triggering sequences of actions. In the context of gaming, Flic switches can be positioned strategically around a player's environment to act as accessible points of control. The small, discreet size and the stick-anywhere design of Flic switches mean they can be placed within reach of different body parts, offering a level of convenience and adaptability. Flic's compatibility with Bluetooth enables seamless integration with various devices and platforms, making it a versatile option for creating an assistive gaming setup.</p>
